                    In 2020 DevTalks has reached A new dimension thought DevTalks Reimagined, bringing together this year more than 4000 participants.
 On 10-12th of June we participated at the biggest DevTalks edition with a premade 3D modeled pit, for which we needed to make visuals that represents our team. Alongside our visuals we prepared 2 videos: one that made a brief description of us and another one that was the one to describe our 4th season robot, the Black Mamba. It took 2 weeks to prepare for this, days in which we gathered at one of our friends home and worked from morning till night to make sure that our robot reaches the wanted design, the videos are ready to represent us and the 3D model of our robot is impressing everyone.

                    On the first day we were very excited to see that there were so many pits every pit with it’s own unique design. Some of them even had quizzes and games after which you had the chance of winning prizes. In the next two days we simply enjoyed the conferences and had a great time.
 
Three days full of joy in which we got the chance of showing the people our work, our progress in 4 years and our passion for what we do. We sure hope to get the chance to participate in the next editions and spread our values with as many people as we can.
