                    1st of December is the National Day of Romania, and it first took place at Alba Iulia, so Xeo decided to organize a fundraising event for a child support center called “Sfânta Maria”, to make a brighter and a happier Saint Nicholas Day for them.
The event was held at our local mall, from 12 pm to 6 pm, an awesome day that took a lot of preparation. We spoke with a few teams to help us organize a scrimmage for the cause. Teams CSH, Rubix and Cyberpunk agreed to join us and compete for the children.
At 12pm, people started to come around and take a look. Our first matches were warm-ups to see if our robots are ready to compete one against the other and to get to know each other better, and with the people and the children who came around.

                    The children that gathered around our field were mesmerized, watching the robot’s every move, their parents asking our volunteers about the FTC competition, our team’s origins and how big the community is.
                    Xeo Academy also helped us by having their robot on show, giving a small presentation about their team and they had a small workshop for children. Robotics themed coloring pages and Christmas ornaments were ready to be painted by the young ones.
                    As a conclusion, the event was absolutely delightful, we managed to earn enough to help the children in need and we managed to form new relationships between the people and the community and between the teams.
