                    For us,Flight Festival is already a tradition. This year, we had the pleasure of participating, in the second edition of our favorite festival in Timisoara, on the 4th-6th September. It was three hot days of summer but we managed to feel, after a long time spent in quarantine, that we had fun this summer. Of course, we didn't lack protection, we took every measure to keep the virus away from us even though we were far from home. 

Flight Festival is an event based on music but does not forget to highlight art or technology. Also this year we represented the bastion of technology with our dear friends from Timisoara, Team CSH, and the team from Arad, Delta Force.

                    We wanted to capture the audience as much as possible so our stand was filled with interactive activities for children and adults, being also safe 

                    One of the main attractions was our 3D printer which constantly printed a model so that viewers could observe it in action. 
                    
                    At the same time, with the help of robots that functioned based on sensors we were able to offer promotional materials 3d printed, robots, and airplanes, without us or the public being in contact with them. 
                    
                    On the same topic, our stand also had a robotic arm that tracked the movements of the hand with the help of a Kinect and the children were very excited about it. 
                    
                    To further energize the atmosphere, for football enthusiasts we also had a table on which 2 robots controlled with the help of the personal phone competed in a football match. 
                    
                    Also, we did not forget to spread the values of FIRST, bringing with us a small part of our competition. We didn't want to leave home either the playing field or the robot, so we brought them with us and made a few demonstration matches with the other teams.
                    
                    This year, Flight Festival has brought us even more. We had the opportunity to participate, two days in a row, in Tech Talks conferences, where we met wonderful people from whom we learned how to start a business, or how with one idea, we can build something great.
