                    We improved it and did it for the second time. From 24.02.2020 to 28.02.2020 we planned to go to the schools in our city and spread the ideas of FIRST and explain what a robotics team does and how we make our robots from the beginning till the end, and, for diversity, we also explained to the children about our events, how we plan them and how we make them work.
We started the week with two presentations at the college “Dorin Pavel” and at the “Mihai Eminescu” school. We were nervous, but with time we got the hang of doing the presentation and started to be better at them minute by minute.

                    We followed on with “Vasile Goldis” school on Tuesday where some children already knew about us and were very excited about us coming to their school and learning more about us and the competition we participated at.
                    Our journey continued till Friday, going from school to school and telling our story from the beginning till the present, our highs and lows but most importantly that we didn’t reach the point where we are today only doing robots, we made friends for life, we grew together and we smiled through hard and easy times. The last school was “Ion Agarbiceanu” where between presentations we participated at one of their breaks where everyone along the hallway was standing near their friends and reading books.It was a full week of exploring, meeting passionate students and learning new things while doing what we love.
