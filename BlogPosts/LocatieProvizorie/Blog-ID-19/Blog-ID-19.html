                    This event started as a thought, how could we do something that would have an impact on society by finding solutions to real-life problems, while also getting teams from all around the globe to collaborate and form new friendships.

We immediately thought about a live discussion in which everyone that wanted to, could be a part of, but we didn't know any platforms that could sustain that many people video- chatting at the same time.

The second idea that we had was to simply contact three more teams from around the globe and to only have the live discussion with them and to answer the questions from the chat. It was a fine idea and we could easily do that, but we would have lost the authenticity and creativity of the event, transforming it into an ordinary one.

After some days of intense thinking, CatÄƒlin came up with a brilliant idea, to make participants collaborate in order to solve problems that were a real threat to the environment and for the planet. His inspiration for this came from an event that former members of our team participated at called Youth Elite, at which teams of 10 would be given a specific place for a possible company that would help the community in one way or another.

                    To get to this idea, he, at first, searched for international days with a meaning that we could use as the main theme of the event, with the closest one being the International Day of Science for Peace and Development, but we had three main issues.

The first one was what the theme would have to do, as a robot would be quite hard to build and we were also going to start the season very soon, so the focus of the participants wasn't going to be on the event, but on their own robots for the competition. Then, the solution came to us, the goal of each team would be to design a robot on the theme of Science for Peace and Development and to present it. The design of the robot would have to be illustrated at least with a drawing or a 3D model.

The second problem actually was the presentation, as we realized that talking about each project, the way the idea came to each of the teams, how the robot would look like and about how it worked would be really hard, especially if we would do it live, so, we decided to let each of the teams present their idea in video that was going be uploaded on a Youtube channel created for the event.

The last problem was how to get more than ten teams into an event like this, as 14  teams seemed to us a reasonable number for the first event of this type. Knowing that the robot would be presented into pre recorded videos, we decided to extend the event from one day, as we initially intended to make it last, to an entire week, posting a video every day.

Another thing that we had to be careful at was that, if we invited teams from all around the globe, there would be a big time difference between some of them and it could cause a lot of problems. To avoid that, we decided that each video was going to be done by two teams that didn't have a difference bigger than three hours between their countries. With that done, the only thing we needed in order to transform this event into reality was 13 more enthusiastic teams from around the globe that were willing to take part in this event.
