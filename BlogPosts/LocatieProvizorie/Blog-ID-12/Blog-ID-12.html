                    This year's situation was... different. We met something new, unfortunately not pleasant, and we have to learn to live with it. However, the first to have contact with the new virus were doctors. They carry the fight for the recovery, for everyone to be safe, and we decided to help them, within our powers, if not closely, at least from a distance. 
So, together with the teams from all over the country, we mobilized ourselves in Alba Iulia and, with the only printer we had at our disposal, we started printing visors. We started with lower requirements from the most affected place, the Infectious Disease Hospital where we were able to get 80 views in a short time. More than 100 visors were donated to the Alba County Emergency Hospital and the COFID And DSP Alba Laboratories Teams after that.

                    We had the 3D model of the visors but what we needed were more people to put their printers to work so, we announced on our social media accounts that we give the model to anyone willing to help. And so collaborations followed with people from Alba Iulia who had personal printers, and they also started printing. We also received help from our community and the CTC Store. They helped us by donating a protective film. The employees of Alba Iulia Municipality did not let us down. They helped us purchase the material needed to make the visors. We also managed to make our work known outside the FTC Community by participating in a video report by Laurentiu Ungureanu and Ionut Duinea for Recorder. ro, where we were invited along with other robotics teams from the country to talk about the help we could give to the doctors on the front line. We had a break period, during which our services were no longer necessary, but it seems that the situation is getting worse,  and we are starting again to manufacture visors, this time for the House of Varstini from Brabant, where the nurses need the best protection.
