On the second day of Xeo Talks 2020, our Alumni members talked about Xeo’s story and journey. At the end of the presentation, Alex asked people if they would like some debates about the university. 
                    Which university you would like to study at and which is the right choice? We have been trying to find answers to these questions since we got to high school. Sometimes it can be difficult to find an answer or make a good decision. 
                    We chose December 19 and 20 because in that way we had enough time to organize it well. Where will it be? This is an online event, so we decided that we will do it on Google Meet and we will broadcast live on our Facebook page. 
                    Two days, one event, 12 wonderful people from “10 Universities of Grade 10” 
                    For the first day, we prepared four universities from three different cities in Romania. Before we started, we asked everyone how they feel today. We started at 16:00 with Alex Drăguș, a 3rd-year student at the Polytechnic University of Bucharest and he is also one of the team’s mentors. After finding out how life is at the University of Bucharest, we went on and the second stop was in Timișoara. From the Polytechnic University of Timișoara, we had three special guests: Mihai Mermezan and Mădălina Rusan who are second-year students and Bogdan David who is in the first year of University. After Timisoara, we approached the house and arrived at the Technical University of Cluj Napoca. We had two special guests from two different sections. Darius Corpodean studies “Automation and computers'' and Alex Leterna studies “Constructions”.

                    We continued the evening with the last guest, Cristian Pop, who is a student at Babes Bolyai University in Cluj. Because he is the only one from a university that is not polytechnic, Cristi tried to impress us from the first moments. The evening ended with a poly vs university discussion. Because Pop Was alone at a non-polytechnic university, the discussion was a kind of poly vs Pop. Subjects, teachers, years of study, benefits, disadvantages and much more were shared.
    The second day started very nice with wonderful Oana Naghiu. She is a freshman at the Faculty of Economics and Business Administration (FSEGA) at Babes Bolyai University. We continued with Maria Serafino who is a student at the Faculty of political, administrative, and communication science (FSPAC) within the Babes Bolyai University in Cluj. Our girls drew a parallel between the universities they study at and then they talked a little about the baccalaureate during the pandemic.
    Continuing the day, we had three more special guests studying abroad. With their help, we were able to have a perspective on education abroad and why they chose to study there. Iulia Trandafir is a former member of the Qube team and is a student at two universities in the Netherlands: "Tilburg University" and "Eindhoven University of Technology". Alexandra Jurca is our alumni and she is a student at the University of Worcester in Great Britain. Eduard Stoica is a student in Denmark in Mechanical Engineering at VIA University College and a former member of the Biytes team.
