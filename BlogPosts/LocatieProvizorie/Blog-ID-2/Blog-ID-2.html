Emotion guides us in all the journeys of life, and our thoughts, decisions and actions define us as people. The power of change is in our hands. Because our mental health is very important, on February 27, at 16:00, we created the Mental Health event in which we discussed with specialists the fingerprints that the last year has on us.
                    We had two lectures given by carefully chosen speakers: Raul Lupaș spoke about “Emotion and reason”. Raul has always had the desire to educate and support others, but especially to understand each other about life. Raul wants to support the process of evolution and transformation of people and communities, both in their personal and professional lives, through training, individual and group coaching, counseling and psychotherapy. On the other hand, he is interested in supporting companies and institutions in developing well-being programs, with the integration of cultural and inter-individual differences.

                    Raul had a wonderful presentation and throughout the conference he wanted the participants to understand the emotions but also the importance of reason. He also recommended two books that could help us: “Poor communication. Effective Discussion Approaches ”- Douglas Stone, Bruce Patton, Sheila Heen and“ How Emotions Arise - Lisa Feldman Barrett ”.
                    Alexandru Pleșea spoke about "The power of self-confidence". Alexandru, known to the public as the Coach of the Mind, is a sociologist, psychotherapist, hypnotherapist and trainer in neuro-linguistic programming. He studied the nature of the human mind in three different educational systems - the United States, Great Britain and Romania and for over 10 years organizes courses and training in Romania, to make people know what possibilities they have when using their intellectual resources and to show the abilities that our mind still has latent.
