                    The winter holidays are the most beautiful of the year, but above the price during this period the most important thing is not to open the souls and to enlighten those of others. Santa Claus exists, and his magic is spread all over the world. We also sprinkled his magic on the children from the family-type house “Izvorul Tămăduirii” from Oarda de Jos, rejoicing the souls of the little angels.
                    The most beautiful moment was when we saw the children happy. On Friday, December 18, we paid a visit to the family-type house "Izvorul Tămăduirii" in Oarda de Jos, where children were waiting for Santa Claus to arrive. But Santa didn't come with the sleigh, he came with the car full of gifts for the obedient children.

                    When we arrived, we unloaded the presents, and then the children sang carols to us. Their angelic voices caressed and warmed our souls. We remembered what the magic of Christmas is and that happiness is in the little things.
After those children caroled us, we talked and we had some unforgettable moments. We promised to pay them a visit with the robot as soon as we had it ready. We can't wait to see them again and spend wonderful moments together.
