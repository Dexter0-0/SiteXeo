                    We discovered through some team members that the blood donation department in Alba Iulia does not have stable resources and that donors are always needed. 
                    Right as we learned this, we mobilized our team and tried as much as possible to mobilize the community in Alba. So, we started a campaign called "#PutemSalvaVieti" on this subject among all the robotics teams.  So that each of them would go to their city and donate blood, and we urged our friends and family to follow our gesture.

                    When we arrived we found out that the donor had to meet certain health conditions and most of us couldnâ€™t donate. Alex was one of our colleagues who met the conditions, and we also had family members who went and donated. 

                    The nurses were excited to see how eager we were to donate, so we assured them that we would come back with even more people to donate. Since then we have decided to continue the action and help a little when we can.
