So we got some ideas, but in the end the one that stands out was made up by 2 big parts: the first one being a small gift to all the girls and women in our high school and the second being a mini concert for all our teachers who help and teach us something new every day.

                    For this we needed to start the preparations with a few weeks before because the little gift was like a greetings card in the shape of a heart (for which we used our origami skills a little) with the name of the person and a specially made sticker. While some people were working like in a factory to finish the 500 hearts, others were doing their best to find out the names of every girl in the high school, and of course teachers and women who make sure that we can study properly.

                    The day before we made the big move and started to place a heart for every girl on her locker, for every teacher in front of her seat in the teachers’ room, and for everyone else in their special place in our school. We were very happy to see how the things turned out, to see that every heart represented a smile on a day that was dedicated to them.

                    On one of the breaks we took action for the next surprise. The little concert was all possible because in the teachers’ room there was an old piano, which Ghișa used to play like no other and impress all the teachers with his talent. After each song played at the piano the cheers were louder and smiles were bigger while we were completely mesmerized by each note that was played.
                    
                    We believe that the small things in life make it beautiful, and that is what we made that day, made people smile and enjoy this special day, Women’s Day.
