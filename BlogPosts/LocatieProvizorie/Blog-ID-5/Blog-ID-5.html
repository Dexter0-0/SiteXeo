                    As every day passed by us, we only got more work, stress, and problems, so we decided to make a relaxing activity that maintains the spirit of teamwork and competition. Due to the pandemic stopping us from planning a face to face event, we came with the idea of a video game tournament that would create a pleasant environment for socializing between clubs and have fun while doing so. 
                The game we chose was League of Legends, a teamwork-based game that improves our cooperation and decision-making skills. The video game consists of two teams of 5 players each, that want to conquer their respective enemy base. Each player chooses a different character to play with unique abilities and looks, delivering a very diverse experience.

                    We had a participation of 19 groups, so we used a play for points method of differentiating, one win equals one point, and loses mean nothing. Why would we use a notation system if this was a friendly activity in which we didn't want to start arguments? Well, we had to risk a bit so we can feel the thrill of competition, to motivate us along the way. The winning team received some in-game cosmetics of their choice. The tournament turned out well, the winners being WattsUp, very honorable opponents that proved to everyone what real humility and kindness are. Having fun is what matters the most, and we are grateful that we entertained everyone, at least for some time.
