                    Our idea to create a Discord server was inspired by the teams from the United States, which actually use this type of communication method to organize events, play games, and even to discuss and design robot ideas, all while sharing them with the other teams. At first, we thought about starting an international discord server, but we quickly realized that there were too many and that we wouldn’t come with anything new, so we decided to create one for all the Romanian teams. To simplify the process of creating it, at first, we gave instructions to two bots that would later do everything automated, giving them things to do as welcoming people, giving them all the info that they would need to know when they join the server, and even playing music if called with the right commands. The next step was to create a role for and every team and with a little over 200 roles ending up being created for them and some extra roles for the organizers of the competition. The next thing was to introduce the role of the server, we did that by creating special voice and text channels for every department, from mechanics to PR, while also adding gaming and meme channels, just so that we would be able to communicate more with the other teams, while also having a lot of fun in the process.

                    Next, we had to clarify what we clearly wanted to do on the server, so we decided to have meetings from time to time with the rest of the teams, discussing everyone’s progress and well-being. Another thing that we wanted to offer was monthly meetings with speakers that could help the teams in different domains and to also organize some of our events here.

For the official launch of the server on the 11th of September, we invited two speakers: Crina Luha and Cornel Amariei, They thought us about the importance of believing in your dream, in your powers and in the fact that everything is possible.

The next meeting was a week later, as we discussed with the rest of the teams their robot ideas and we watched some videos of some robot in 3 days designs to break them down and learn some more about how we could assembly specific systems. 

After this, we continued to use the server for having occasional gaming evenings with some of the other teams and to still discuss ideas whenever we felt like it.
