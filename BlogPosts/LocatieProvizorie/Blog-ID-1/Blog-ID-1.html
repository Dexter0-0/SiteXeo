It represents a beginning, which we hope will be good. 
                    The idea came to being due to our desire to include multiple teams into an activity, which would be easier if not for the covid crises that we were found in. But we did not give up on it and found a way, using our wonderful 3D modeling experts.

                    The lucky trinkets that we would exchange are easily modeled, we just needed more people to join in it. So we decided to transform this tradition into a full fledged event, resembling a “spring secret santa”. Our designers made a presentation poster themed with this, the final product being a combination of different themes of the divine reborn with a little detail, a bow made with a red and white string that defines the theme of the custom. Then with some creative writing we succeeded in announcing this action, succeeding in bringing 13 teams in our gift exchange. The project begins with the charm, which was 3D modeled, printed and sent to the paired team that we assigned. In our promoteing we used the #matishareuieste to keep this trend going for a little longer. 
                    Our “mărțișor” came to be a flower, the emblem of the dawn of rejuvenation, as a way of encouraging them to not give up and never be afraid to start anew. We got a robot-looking one from our esteemed competitors, cyberpunk, to keep their team’s theme going, motivating us not to lose our spirit.
