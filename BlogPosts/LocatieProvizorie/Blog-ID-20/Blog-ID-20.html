                    ORGANAZING<br><br>
After the last day of Xeo Summer School we had a meeting and to discuss  XeoTalks. This year we wanted to be bigger than last year and we started thinking about it 2 months before. We wanted to keep the idea of the last year with conferences about different subjects that can make everyone learn new things. 
We needed to decide which dates the events should take place and to keep the tradition alive, we wanted to make the event in the last weekend of October 25th-27th so we could organize a Halloween party too.

<br><br>FIRST DAY<br><br>
We started the day really excited. We packed all the things we needed at the event and went to the university where the conferences took place, which is also where we made the reception of the teams this year.
We started with a brief presence of all teams that were in Alba Iulia for Xeo Talks, 29 teams and more than 170 people.
The opening celebration of the event was held where we joined Mr. Daniel Breaz Rector of the University “1 Decembrie 1918”, Corina Rotar  Dean of the Faculty of accurate and Engineering sciences at the University “1 Decembrie 1918” and Mr. Liviu Stanciu, representative of the municipality of Alba Iulia.
After the officials, teams had the opportunity to visit Alba Iulia through a treasure hunt organized in the Alba Carolina fortress that they all managed to complete.
At the end of the day, we organized discussions about the following season at our highschool. Some tips and tricks about sponsors, money for the team and events organized by teams.
There were simultaneous discussions about the technical and non-technical parts. There were also some ideas about the new season theme, Skystone 

<br><br>THE SECOND DAY<br><br>
The main day was the conference day. We all joined together to learn new things from people who wanted to share some of their experience and give us some tips that could help us through life.

                    Even if we make robots and Marius Bîcu is the owner of a company that produces cheese, we thought that there is actually a common point.  It was a speech dedicated to leaders of the teams who have to be always impartial and see the best solutions for their teams.
<br><br>PUBLIC SPEAKING-CĂTĂLINA MOLEAVIN<br><br>
Cătălina came to teach us some tips about how to speak easily in public. She helped us learn how to control our emotions during an interview, what’s right to do and say and what’s not.
<br><br>TEAMWORK- ANDREI (YETI) AVRAM<br><br>
Yeti came to speak about teamwork. Being in a team is probably harder than you thought, because you have to compare different ideas and understand that sometimes your idea is not the best. 

<br><br>STORY OF XEO<br><br>
We also wanted to have a special moment when we could talk about our journey throughout three seasons of the competition. To tell everyone what we would have done better in these years and what we learned.
Because of that, we let the founders of Xeo talk about it. Like any team we faced problems, but being together, we managed to overcome them. Because, after all, as we like to say, Xeo is more than just a team, Xeo is a family.

<br><br>MENTORSHIP-  GABRIELA ALEXANDRU<br><br>
Gabriela talked about mentorship by being a teacher. Even if the speech was destinated to our mentors, we are all mentors in our lives with our family and friends.
<br><br>NEUROMARKETING- CRINA LUHA<br><br>
Crina talked about neuromarketing, which is not a pretty common subject because it is not that marked in our daily lives. For teams, this was an interesting subject because we learned to promote our team and make it more visual for public.
<br><br>HALLOWEEN PARTY<br><br>
After a long day everyone deserves a break so it’s time for the Halloween Party!  Even if we said at first that the costumes are not mandatory, a lot of people came dressed as different characters. 

<br><br>THE THIRD DAY<br><br>
We started the day with our special guest, Cazacu Alexandru, who helped us with a Creo and AR workshop. 
After the workshop as we mentioned at the closing ceremony, we wanted to premiere our sponsors from the season. Then it followed the awarding of participating teams. And finally, we wanted to say a few words to all the people joined us for 3 days and attended our event!
