                    The planet is our home, our only home, so we must keep it clean, healthy and happy. We should give back all the love mother nature gives us and make sure that she has everything she needs.
      As a tribute for everything we have from this wonderful world, we made a 5 days information campaign to make sure everyone knows about the problems the planet has, because pollution is a real problem. Animals are dying because their home was destroyed by deforestation, their water is poisoned with toxic chemicals and the soil is contaminated. Also, food wasting is an important subject that directly affects global hunger. 
      On the first day, we talked about deforestation, what it is, why it is so important and especially how it affects us. After that, on the next day we explained why reusable bags are the best option, how plastic bags tend to disrupt the environment in a serious way. They get into the soil and slowly release toxic chemicals. 
      We also tried to give information about bamboo cutlery and how the little plastic pieces from one use cutlery unfortunately are eaten by animals that often choke and die. On Thursday and Friday we talked about battery and drugs recycling and food waste.

                    To end the week in a positive way we talked about the Eco Values, what it means and how beautiful it is to feel that you leave this world better than you found it. How together we can save and protect the earth, our only home.

                <p class = "TextPrimary BlogText">
                    We wanted to continue the initiative, so, in order to do something concrete, we decided to do a greening around our highschool. 
Garbage bags, gloves, masks and joy are the principle ingredients to a perfect day.
With goodwill and energy, we started to work. In 2-3 hours we managed to gather almost 10 full garbage bags and our school garden looked as good as ever.

                </h1>
                <p class = "TextPrimary BlogText">
                    Even if this year Christmas holidays are a little different and we are gonna spend almost all the time in houses, we still love to decorate everything and make sure we are ready for the most beautiful time of the year. 

So, we thought about an eco-friendly alternative to replace all the plastic and only one use Christmas decorations. They are nocive for the environment, when they break into pieces and all the pieces end up in the sea where they are eaten by animals who unfortunately will die.

We organised and made different models and copies, but we wanted to find a new home for them. We planned to give all the decoration and a lot of candies on 6th of December to an orphanage. All we wanted to do was to put a smile on those children`s face. 

We also made tutorials of the decoration in order to help other people to choose a better alternative, a small gesture with a big effect on the environment.
St. Nicholas was very modern and eco-friendly this year!
