                    Improve, was one of our main events last year and its purpose was to help the newer and even the veteran teams prepare themselves better for the national competition. In order to do that, we thought of the 5 base main points to cover regarding a FTC competition and we came up with this: 
<br><br>1. Team work and events, a subject that we talked about with team RO074 CSH, as we invited them, like we did with all the participants from the next days, to help us get a better and a more diverse look into the situation, doing this live on our <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=198668788067336" target = "_blank" style = "color: rgb(74, 136, 251);">Facebook page</a>
<br><br>2. Sustainability, budget and sponsors, a domain which we talked about with teams RO186 The Resistance and RO118 Code Warriors, two teams from the same school, the last one being actually the creator of the newer one and we wanted to see how their relationship was, given the fact that they are still two different teams and what was their approach to the possible sponsors <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=146258189946921 " target = "_blank" style = "color: rgb(74, 136, 251);">Facebook live</a>

                    3. Judging and awards, a theme discussed with team 14270 Quantum Robotics, regarding all the steps that a team would have to consider and go through to prepare themselves for the judging and all the stuff that they had to pay attention to so that their engineering notebook could be taken into consideration for each specific award <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=494958134516467" target = "_blank" style = "color: rgb(74, 136, 251);">Facebook live</a>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    4. Problem-solving, a subject that weâ€™ve previously talked about in another event that we participated in, but that we felt was too important to be left out. We got through the basics and even some of the more advanced problem-solving methods and mindsets with the help of team RO014 Qube <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=2265913983712635" target = "_blank" style = "color: rgb(74, 136, 251);">Facebook live</a>
                    <br><br><br><br>
                    5. The engineering notebook. We knew that a lot of teams had questions and were unsure how to organize their engineering notebook, so we invited team RO005 Esentza Robotics to be our partners in the process of describing how to think, write and organize such a notebook and all the basics that needed to be covered, in order to have your notebook considered by the judges for, not only specific awards, but also the Inspire award <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=135330514568204" target = "_blank" style = "color: rgb(74, 136, 251);">Facebook live</a>
