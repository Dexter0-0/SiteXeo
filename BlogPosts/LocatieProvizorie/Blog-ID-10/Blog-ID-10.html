                    Robots to the rescue was a world wide competition which was hosted by PTC and had teams from different countries think about 3D modelled robots that were able to solve real world problems. Every robot gained points after a specific criteria that was based on creativity, design process, functionality, and real-life utility, bonus points being awarded to those teams who cooperated with other teams to create their robots together.
We paired up with team RO186 The Resistance and, after some meetings at which we discussed what we could do and the actual way of transforming our ideas into reality, we got to the theme of cleaning the sea waters and shores of trash. We decided that we would design the water debris collecting robot and they would design the other one, as we already had an idea regarding this one.

                    So, after we designed the base floating part of the robot, we got to the trash collecting and smashing mechanism and, as we knew that the regular FTC dimensions wouldn’t be enough, we designed a moving wall inside the robot that would orientate the garbage that was going inside of the robot to a certain place and, from that moment, the wall was starting to apply pressure on the debris and, from the walls, some sharp blades would start to go out and cut through the plastic so that it could be pressured more than by only getting some air out of it. Then, the pressured trash would be lifted into a compartment mounted on linear slides, which would then extend as far as 2 meters, to be able to deliver the trash to our partners on the shore, as they would collect it by standing under the compartment and it being rotated to 90 degrees so that it could be emptied.
In the end we had to make a little manual of our robot that described it and it’s use, that helped us get to the 36 place at the competition out of 400 si ceva teams that entered in this competition.
