                    In March, we celebrate women and femininity, and we wanted to celebrate them by thanking the doctors and nurses at the vaccination centers in our city who are fighting to stop this pandemic. We like to get involved in the community we belong to and help those around us as much as we can. We are creative and we like to leave our innovative imprint everywhere and that's why we chose to offer the ladies some 3D-printed flowers that have in the middle the logos of our teams, on one side Xeo, and on the other Xeo Academy.

                    The idea came from the desire to make the ladies feel appreciated for everything they do. Initially, we wanted to make some brooches but everything seemed quite difficult and useless. Then came this idea with a flower-shaped pencil head, which is a small but useful gesture. Along with the flowers I shared some flyers and sent a warm wish. Because it was an equal job, we modeled and printed the flowers, and Xeo Academy made the flyers. Together we divided them at the two centers in Alba Iulia. 
                    We hope that we have managed to bring joy to everyone in our souls and that our little gesture has made the ladies feel appreciated because we are grateful to them for everything they do. If they were happy, we were filled with a lot of positive energy and enthusiasm that we all need in these times.
