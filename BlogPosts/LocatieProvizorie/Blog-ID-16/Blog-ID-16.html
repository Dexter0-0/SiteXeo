                <p class = "TextPrimary BlogText AnimationFadeIn1">On the 29th of february, 2020, a unique day that occurs only every 4 years, we organized one of our most ambitious events of this season, The Xeo Scrimmage, long for TXS. It consisted of a series of demonstrative matches, attended by 16 teams in total, approximated to around 180 people and besides this, an hour-long conference about everything that has to do with the FTC world, from technical advice to stuff linked to the engineering notebook and marketing & design advice as well. All the information was provided by our wonderful guests, Dan Gaidău and Robert Sîrbu, two very experienced people that have volunteered for Nație Prin Educație for many years.

                    We’ll start a day early, on the 28th. This was the day dedicated to preparations, getting ready for everybody and everything. The promotional materials were ready to go, to be distributed to all the teams. The place where all this madness would take place was our high school’s gym, a huge and tall room, with seats on one side, perfect to admire the games that would take place just in the middle, as normal. We tested the sound to make sure everything sounded right. The tables and the chairs were all put up in place, and the conference room, “The room of mirrors” as we like to call it, got all set up as well, with over 100 chairs so we could fit as many people as possible.

                    The following day was the day of the event. Early in the morning, everybody was present at 7 o'clock because we still had a lot of work to do, and the most important part of all was warmly welcoming the teams to our scrimmage. Together with our lovely colleagues from Xeo Academy, we managed to prepare the portfolios for everybody, a little snack stand, and the game fields. Teams started to roll in, to make themselves comfortable. An opening ceremony marked the official start of TXS. Slowly, each arriving team was called to the technical inspection (our technical chief, Besi, was in charge, of course). Fortunately, everybody had passed in one way or another, and they soon started to get ready for the games. A total of 22 games we played, out of which every team had a good outcome. Of course we had a break as well, which occurred at halftime. It was time for lunch, and we gave every team free hot meals, thanks to our sponsors who made this possible. 

After the lunch break, the highlight of TXS happened. We guided everybody to the conference room, where they were awaited by our guests, Dan and Robert, ready to be shot at with tons of questions. They were happy to present themselves, and then the discussion started. It was mostly a session of Q&A, to which some of our alumni were happy to join, and discussed themes such as design and the engineering notebook. This proved to be extremely productive and effective, mainly because people didn’t hesitate to join the discussion and made it even more interesting than we thought it would be. Also, our past engineering notebooks went from hand to hand and were studied by the other students, so they could analyze our progress and maybe get some ideas on how to improve or change theirs.


The conference ended, and the matches continued. We were impressed by the progress that other teams managed to make since the Regional Tournament, and it really got us working harder. The atmosphere was great, as we had wanted. Before starting the semifinals, there was a break, in which we managed to create a flash mob, and everybody joined and started dancing with us. In the end, the finals arrived, and the alliances that fought against each other were as follows: IDeaL Electronics(captain) and Herotech(1st pick) against Cyberpunk(captain) and Rutherbots(1st pick). The winning alliance proved to be the one composed of IDeaL Electronics and Herotech, which we wish to congratulate and wish nothing but further success.   
Every team that took part in this event gets our sincere congratulations, because after all the main objective of the event was to create a great energy and everybody have a good time. Thank you everybody for allowing this to happen, because this event would have been nothing without you, and you create this wonderful community in which we are grateful to live and be an active part of!
