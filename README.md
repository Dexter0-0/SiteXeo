<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


In the 5th season (Ultimate goal) our team decided that we needed to have a website. After a few weeks of back and forth between the PR and the Design departments and the Programming Department we launched this website. 

The PR and Design departments listed a couple of features the website must have:
* A simple minimalist design with a dark background and pastel colors.
* Short about and team members section.
* A Sponsors Section
* A blog feed with different events going on in our team + the teams Instagram account feed.
* Switching between showing the blog feed and our actual Instagram feed.
* Short interactive Contact page.

<!-- BUILT WITH -->
## Built With

In order to make a better responsive website I used some third party stuff:

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com)
* [TweenMax](https://greensock.com/)
